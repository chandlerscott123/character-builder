      <img src="img/high-elf.jpeg">
      <p id =char-desc>
        High Elves are known as the intellectuals of the world. <br>
        They are very pretentious, often peering down at village folk <br> 
        from their spired walls. This weakness is their strength, for <br>
        their mental fortitude grants them gifts in <em>charisma,</em> <em>intelligence,</em> <br> 
        and <em>alchemy.</em>
      </p>

      <h2 id ="char-desc-title"> Dark Elf </h2>
      <img src="img/dark-elf.png">
      <p id =char-desc>
        The fallen angels of the High Elves. Due to their deftness and <br>
        stealth, some say that Dark Elves are descendants of the night itself.<br>
        Gifted in <em>theivery,</em> <em>magic,</em> <br> 
        and <em>alchemy.</em>
      </p>

      <h2 id ="char-desc-title">Paladin</h2>
      <img src="img/paladin.jpeg">
      <p id =char-desc>
        Only a fool would challenge the Paladin in hand to hand combat!<br> 
        The Paladins brutish strength makes up most of their power,<br>
        so their capacity to reason through a situation is very limited. 
        That said,there is a reason the Paladins are royalty in the kingdoms 
        of the world. Gifted in <em>strength,</em> <em>armor,</em> <br> 
        and <em>blacksmithing.</em>
      </p>

    <div id = "lighteyes-box" class = "container hidden">
      <h2 id ="char-desc-title">Alethi Lighteyes</h2>
      <img src="img/ligtheyes.jpeg">
      <p id =char-desc>
        The rulers of the Vorin kingdoms. These are humanoids of Herald-chosen <br>
        royalty. Although some Lighteyes fight bravely in battle, the most <br>
        accurate words to describe a light eyes would be noble, pretentious<br>
        and sheltered. Gifted in <em>divinity,</em> <em>charisma,</em><br> 
        and <em>bartering.</em>
